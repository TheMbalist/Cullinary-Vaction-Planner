# Cullinary-Vaction-Planner

<h1>Project Introduction</h1>
<p>Cullinary Vaction Project is a passion project made by a girl who gets nervous at the mere idea of leaving the comfort of her mother's house but loves the idea of traveling. This is a project to help those who seek to get a taste of the world by providing them the platform to build itineraries of their favourite destinations based on various cuisines and their culinary preferences. Culinary Vacation Planner is an idea I helped formulate with the help of ChatGPT in which I gave vague ideas of what I was thinking and ChatGPT was able to provide me with ideas to choose from based on that, and when this idea graced my eyes, I knew I had to try it out. I have no idea if an application or platform like this exists (it's highly likely that it does) but I hope the fun I had in completing this project, the valuable practice I got from it and the ability to use it as an excuse not to go anywhere all reflect in this project and your experience using it.</p>
